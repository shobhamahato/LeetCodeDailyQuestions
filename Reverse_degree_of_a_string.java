/*
Question :
Given a string s, calculate its reverse degree.

The reverse degree is calculated as follows:

For each character, multiply its position in the reversed alphabet ('a' = 26, 'b' = 25, ..., 'z' = 1) with its position in the string (1-indexed).
Sum these products for all characters in the string.
Return the reverse degree of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: 148

class Solution {
    public int reverseDegree(String s) {
        int sum=0,v;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            v='z'-s.charAt(i)+1;
            sum+=v*(i+1);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
